# Elk

Elk is **my personal** photo manager. I started to hate Picasa, because it was pretending to be smarter than me. I like file-system based management and I couldn't find a folder-based manager which could simply synchronize photos with Picasa Web Albums and save properly metadata into JPEG files.

## Status: HOBBY PROJECT

This my hobby project is under bit-by-bit development. No rush. No other people use or need it, anyway.

## Installation

Only *buntu box is supported.

`pip install https://github.com/honzajavorek/elk.git#egg=elk`

Read carefully what the installation says to you as there are some additional dependencies on other *buntu packages.

## Why Elk?

Because it is a lovely short word. Short enough to be typed often into my Xubuntu terminal. <small>And because I lived in Finland for half of a year and actually quite like these animals.</small>
