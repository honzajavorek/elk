# Elk

My personal photo manager. I started to hate Picasa, because it was pretending to be smarter than me. I like file-system based management and I couldn't find a folder-based manager which could simply synchronize photos with Picasa Web Albums and save properly metadata into JPEG files.

## Status: HOBBY PROJECT

This my hobby project is under bit-by-bit development. No rush. No other people use or need it, anyway.

## Installation

Try to just run `install` script from your terminal. Elk depends on some external tools, such as `ExifTool`, `ImageMagick`, `ffmpeg`, etc.

<small>Near future: `python setup.py install` ([issue #1](https://github.com/honzajavorek/elk/issues/1))</small>

## Why Elk?

Because it is a lovely short word. Short enough to be typed often into my Xubuntu terminal. <small>And because I lived in Finland for half of a year and actually quite like these animals.</small>
