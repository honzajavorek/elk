Elk

What is Elk?
==============
My personal photo manager. I started to hate Picasa, because
it was pretending to be smarter than me. I like file-system
based management and I couldn't find a folder-based manager
which could simply synchronize photos with Picasa Web Albums
and save properly metadata into JPEG files.

Why Elk?
==============
Because it is a lovely short word. Short enough to be
typed often into Ubuntu terminal.
